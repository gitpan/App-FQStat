NAME
    App::FQStat - Interactive console front-end for Sun's grid engine

SYNOPSIS
      Just run fqstat.pl

DESCRIPTION
    "App::FQStat" is the internal module that runs the "fqstat.pl" tool.
    "fqstat" is an interactive, console based front-end for Sun's Grid
    Engine (<http://gridengine.sunsource.net/>).

    This has grown out of an in-house tool I wrote just for convenience, but
    I believe it may be useful to others who loathe the ugly and slow Java
    GUI "qmon" that comes with the grid engine software and who find the
    huge list of jobs coming out of "qstat" to be painful.

    Usage of the tool is quite simple. Run it, it'll show all current jobs
    on the cluster. Hit "h" to get online-help or F10 to enter the menu.

    "fqstat" was tested against a couple of versions of the grid engine
    software starting somewhere around 6.0. If you find an incompatibility,
    please let me know.

=head1 NAME

App::FQStat - Interactive console front-end for Sun's grid engine

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  Just run fqstat.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<App::FQStat> is the internal module that runs the C<fqstat.pl> tool.
C<fqstat> is an interactive, console based front-end for Sun's Grid Engine
(L<http://gridengine.sunsource.net/>).

This has grown out of an in-house tool I wrote just for convenience,
but I believe it may be useful to others who loathe the ugly and slow
Java GUI C<qmon> that comes with the grid engine software and who
find the huge list of jobs coming out of C<qstat> to be painful.

Usage of the tool is quite simple. Run it, it'll show all current jobs
on the cluster. Hit "h" to get online-help or F10 to enter the menu.

C<fqstat> was tested against a couple of versions of the grid engine
software starting somewhere around 6.0. If you find an incompatibility,
please let me know.
